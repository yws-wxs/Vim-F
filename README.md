# Vim-F: Visual State Space Model Benefiting from Learning in the Frequency Domain

## Introduction

This project is based on Vim ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09417), [code](https://github.com/hustvl/Vim)) and we appreciate this excellent work. You only need to replace the original `models_mamba.py` with ours to reimplement our work.


## ImageNet classification

| Model       | Dataset   | Resolution | Top1 | Ckpt/Logs  |
